PROJECT NAME
============

Skeleton project directory. This is derived from Learning Python to Hard Way
exercise #46.

What to do
----------

1. Copy this directory somewhere else. Name it after your new project.
2. Rename the `NAME/` directory to the name of your project (or whatever you
   would like to call your root module).
3. Edit `setup.py` accordingly for the project.
4. Rename `tests/NAME_tests.py` to have the new module name.
5. Double check everything is working by running `nosetests` while in the
   directory containing `README.md`.
6. Update `README.md` to describe your new project.
